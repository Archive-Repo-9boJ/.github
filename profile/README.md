# Project Holding & Archive

Welcome! This organization serves as a permanent holding area for projects that are no longer under active development by me.

All repositories here have been moved from my primary GitHub account, [@your-username]([https://github.com/your-username](https://github.com/9boJ)), to keep it clean and focused on my current work.

### Status of Repositories

All projects within this organization should be considered **archived and unmaintained**.

* **No Future Updates:** The code is provided "as-is". There will be no new features, updates, or patches.
* **Read-Only:** For all practical purposes, consider these repos as read-only. Issues and pull requests will be ignored.
* **Preservation:** The sole purpose of this organization is to preserve past work.

If you find something useful, you are more than welcome to fork the repository and adapt it for your own needs.
